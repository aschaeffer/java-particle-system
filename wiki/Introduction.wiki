= Physics =

  * domain pattern: particles are just data (no logic)
  * flexible particles: you can add features to particles
  * physic system contains multiple emitters, multiple modifiers, multiple particle features
  * multiple types of emitters (PointEmitter, PlaneEmitter, RingEmitter, SphereEmitter)
  * multiple types of modifiers:
    * VelocityTransformation (important!)
    * GravityPoint
    * GravityPlane
    * BlackHole
    * ColorTransformation (linear, random, rainbow ...)
    * SizeTransformation (linear, ...)
    * ParticleCulling (bounding box, sphere, ...)
  * listerner pattern: onParticleCreation, onParticleDeath
  * configurable, loading / saving physics

= Particle Rendering =

  * using point sprites
  * using sprite sheets
  * billboarding: textures are aimed to the camera
  * blending
  * multiple render types for particles
    * SimplePoint
    * ColoredPoint
    * ComplexPoint
    * SimpleTriangle
    * SimpleTriangleStrip
    * SimpleLineStrip
    * SimpleQuad
    * PointSprite
    * SmokeParticle (point sprite)
    * FireParticle (point sprite, sprite sheet animation)
    * ElectricParticle (point sprite, sprite sheet animation)

= Scene =

  * different types of renderers (cameras, huds, RenderTypeRenderer, EmitterRenderer, GravityPointRenderer)
  * different types of cameras (FPSCamera)
  * cycling through cameras at runtime
  * multiple huds (Information about FPS, Cameras, ParticleCount ...)
  * hud command system (for example to display notification   messages)
  * picking/moving (e.g. selecting and moving emitters, gravity points ...)
  * hud editor system (editing emitters, gravity points ...)
  * configurable, loading / saving scenes

= Overall =

  * Physics independent from rendering
  * Implementation in Java style (using interfaces, abstract classes, implementation classes, references, factory methods ...)
  * Very flexible
  * increased performance: physics and rendering are seperated into its own threads
  * (optional:) increased performance: multiple physics threads operating on a bucket of particles
